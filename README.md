# Simple-Learning-Blazor-Website

This was a project created in a week to teach me the fundamentals of Blazor file structure and the layout of a Blazor Website. Some things that I learned is how to link up separate code, styling and page files in Blazor and implementation of a navigation bar.

This project also followed the Software Development Life Cycle, to see my artifacts from the phases such as Requirements, Design, and Testing, check out the Artifacts folder in the repository.
