R1 - As a developer, I want to create a new blank Blazor project, so that I’ll have a
basic working environment to start with.

so that I’ll know how to properly develop with it.

that I have a homepage to go to.

the second page, so that I can tell when I navigate between them.

R4 - As a user, I want the second page to have different text on it from the homepage,
so that I can tell when I navigate between them.
